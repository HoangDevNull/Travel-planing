My photographer and I skied down into a tiny hamlet, where we sat on a sunny rock and waited. Soon all of these kids starting coming out of their mud brick houses with their own skis and snowboards that they’d fashioned out of plastic Iranian cooking oil jugs, old barn doors, and wire bucket handles.

"<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">I stared at the two orange tickets in my hand, given to me by a stranger, each with a number written on it in green – 11 and 52. I had taken a gamble, and I was starting to believe that it wasn’t going to pay off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">Ed and I had come to</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;"> </span><a href="https://www.worldnomads.com/explore/north-america/united-states/a-vegetarian-on-the-barbecue-trail" target="_self"><span style="color: rgb(9,79,144);background-color: transparent;font-size: inherit;font-family: Tahoma;">Austin</span></a><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;"> for a quick getaway, and he was indulging my need to find a quirky hidden gem in the city. I had convinced him to follow me to Ginny’s Little Longhorn Saloon, where we were sitting on plastic lawn chairs in the parking lot, just a few feet from a dumpster and porta-potty, slowly losing our will to live in Austin’s sweltering heat. He wasn’t saying much; I couldn't tell if he was annoyed at being pulled into another of my questionable exploits, or if he was silently suffering because he’d overindulged at Torchy’s Tacos.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">I looked around, glancing back over to the group of people bustling around a chicken coop in the middle of the parking lot. They were emitting cries of excitement, followed by huge sighs of disappointment. I had walked away from them just moments before, the excitement and boredom combining to take their toll.</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p>
<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2040627/pexels-photo-2040627.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260" alt="100%" style="height: 100%;width: 100%"/>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">“Let’s just go,” I said. “There’s no chance it’s going to be me.” I suggested we head to the State Capitol to check off at least one  ‘must-see’. But Ed insisted we wait. He settled back into his chair, refusing to admit his food coma was responsible for keeping us in place, melting in the heat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">Minutes later, a much louder roar erupted from the direction of the chicken coop. Ed had fallen asleep, so I headed back to the crowd and jostled my way to the front. My eyes zoomed in on the floor of the coop, scanning the square grid of numbers for 11 and 52.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">Then I spotted it – a huge piece of chicken poop, dumped right between the two ones that made up the number 11.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">I edged my way in a little closer, trying to make eye contact with the chicken I had built my hopes and dreams upon – at the going rate of $5 per ticket.</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p>

"<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">I stared at the two orange tickets in my hand, given to me by a stranger, each with a number written on it in green – 11 and 52. I had taken a gamble, and I was starting to believe that it wasn’t going to pay off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">Ed and I had come to</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;"> </span><a href="https://www.worldnomads.com/explore/north-america/united-states/a-vegetarian-on-the-barbecue-trail" target="_self"><span style="color: rgb(9,79,144);background-color: transparent;font-size: inherit;font-family: Tahoma;">Austin</span></a><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;"> for a quick getaway, and he was indulging my need to find a quirky hidden gem in the city. I had convinced him to follow me to Ginny’s Little Longhorn Saloon, where we were sitting on plastic lawn chairs in the parking lot, just a few feet from a dumpster and porta-potty, slowly losing our will to live in Austin’s sweltering heat. He wasn’t saying much; I couldn't tell if he was annoyed at being pulled into another of my questionable exploits, or if he was silently suffering because he’d overindulged at Torchy’s Tacos.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(42,43,41);background-color: rgb(254,254,254);font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;">I looked around, glancing back over to the group of people bustling around a chicken coop in the middle of the parking lot. They were emitting cries of excitement, followed by huge sighs of disappointment. I had walked away from them just moments before, the excitement and boredom combining to take their toll.</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p>
